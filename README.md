# maroon-socket

Repository for the maroon-socket team's work. In this repository we are developing a web app that lets you add plants and get notifications to water them via connecting to your telegram. It also has a community section where you can create posts and comment on them.

## Telegram bot setup

This project needs a telegram bot to send notifications to user. To create a telegram bot you need to create a telegram accound and message the bot named @Botfather.

Type `/newbot` in its chat to start the process of creating a new bot and follow the instructions. If at some points it tells you that username is already taken then just keep trying until it succeeds.

sucessfully creating a bot will give you a token and url.

Your token will look something like this:
`4839XXX812:AAFD39kkdpWt3yXXXXXrgyOLMaJhac60qc`
Paste it in server's .env for `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, look at .env.sample if you need examples.

The url will look something like this:
`t.me/plantpalremind_bot`
you need to add `?start=true` to the end and paste it in client .env for `VITE_TELEGRAM_BOT_URL`, look at .env.sample if you need examples.
