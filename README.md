# maroon-socket

Repository for the maroon-socket team's work. In this repository we are developing a web app that lets you add plants and get notifications to water them via connecting to your telegram. It also has a community section where you can create posts and comment on them.

## Telegram bot setup

This project needs a telegram bot to send notifications to user. To create a telegram bot you need to create a telegram accound and message the bot named @Botfather.

Type `/newbot` in its chat to start the process of creating a new bot and follow the instructions. If at some points it tells you that you bot's name should have `bot` at the end of it then make the b capital like this `maroon_Bot` it might otherwise say that the username is already taken.

finishing this setup you should have a url (used in client) to your bot and a token(used in server) for the bot. look at the env files for client and server folders for instructions on setting them.
